CMSC 473 Assignment 2
James Lee <jlee23@umbc.edu>

A grammar and parser for English noun phrases.

To run this program, a Common Lisp environment is required.  I tested it with
clisp:

$ clisp
> (load "np-parser.lisp")
> (parse "the four beautiful airplanes that finished the runway")


Unlike Assignment 1, this one unfortunately doesn't work for me.  I have spent
hours debugging and must regretfully submit it as it is.  The first thing I
implemented was the "unify" function which directly follows the algorithm
listed in Figure 11.8 of the book.  All the feature structures I have unified
with this function have return the expected result.  Next I decided how I
should represent my grammar rules.  I eliminated all the non-terminals that
dealt with agreement and added the feature structures represented by DAGs which
are lists of arcs.  I think my choice to represent feature structures in this
way have made things more difficult.  Lisp provides all of features I needed to
represent this such as the ability to share lists using real pointers rather
than arcs labeled pointers.  Regardless, I tried to make the best out of it by
working on the modifications to the Earley parser as per Figure 11.12 of the
book, including the changes to the "Earley state," and completer functions.
