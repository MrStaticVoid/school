CSCI 6331 -- Cryptography
Homework 3

See 'output.txt' for the table of the top ten biases.  The table was computed
using the Erlang script contained in 'hw3' (executable file).  The program can
be run like:

    $ ./hw3

It takes a long time (~5 minutes) to run on hobbes because Erlang doesn't seem
to want to compile the code to native SPARC instructions.  It works much better
on x86.
