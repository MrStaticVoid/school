\begin{slide}{Preventing Social Engineering Attacks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Two sides of attack: physical and psychological
\item First step: develop well rounded security policy
\item Security policies ``remove the responsibility of the employee to make judgment-calls regarding a hacker's request.''
\item The security policy should address:
\begin{itemize}
\item Information access control
\item Setting-up accounts
\item Access approval
\item Password changes
\item Physical security
\item Information disposal
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Preventing Physical Attacks}
\begin{itemize}
\item IDs must be checked and verified
\item Sensitive documents must be locked in safe places
\item Dumpsters should be locked and monitored
\item Computers must be well secured by good passwords.
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Policy Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
\item All employees should be educated about the security policy
\item Have annual refreshers
\item Prevent security relaxation
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
