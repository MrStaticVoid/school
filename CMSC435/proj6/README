Project 6
James Lee <jlee23@umbc.edu>

This project adds a shader to the table top which was designed to look like the
tile in "floor-tile-found-from-the-god-of-google.jpg".  The shader is
implemented in tile.sl.  It first draws the entire surface the color of the
grout, then composes the ceramic parts on top.  Only a quarter of the tile was
actually constructed, then rotated around three times to complete the image,
since it was symmetrical.  The ceramic parts were colored by checking the
boundaries of a square with an additional check to handle the diagonal lines in
the tile.  Low frequency noise was added to the grout and white tile bits to
simulate dirt, and high frequency noise was added in varying amounts to all
parts of the tile to simulate texture.  Finally, to make it look more
realistic, I applied the matte lighting effect to the grout and plastic
lighting effect to the ceramic.  The effect of this is visible in the bright
spotlight, where it's being reflected intensely by the ceramic.

I only used the Pixie wiki for help on this project.

This project can be built by simply typing "make" at the command line.
