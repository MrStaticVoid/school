Project 5
James Lee <jlee23@umbc.edu>

This project includes a parser to read NFF files which describe a scene.  The
scene is rendered using ray-tracing techniques.  I have written it in Java, the
language with which I am most familiar.  To build it:

$ ant clean
$ ant compile

To run it:

$ java org.thestaticvoid.raytracer.RayTracer < foo.nff > foo.ppm
$ display foo.ppm

I have implemented everything required by the project description.
Additionally, I have added sphere tracing and concave polygon tracing.
I have added shading for spheres and interpolated normals for n-sided polygonal
patches.
