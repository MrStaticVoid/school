Project 3
James Lee <jlee23@umbc.edu>

This assignment is based on Project 2 in that a mountain is procedurally
modeled.  In this project, the mountain is modeled statically, that is, it does
not change during runtime.  It was changed to a perspective view, rotating
around a point which is supposed to represent a car.  This car can move aronud
using the mouse.  When it goes over the mountain, the point where the car is
will elevate to the height of the triangle it is hovering over.  This triangle
is determined using barycentric coordinates.  The same barycentric coordinates
are used to interpolate the normals from the three points.  Finally, the
viewpoint is rotated such that the interpolated normal is pointing up.

The project can be built by typing "make" in its base directory.

Running the project with arguments:

4 1
4 2

yield mountains which are fun to drive over.
