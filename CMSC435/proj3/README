Project 2
James Lee <jlee23@umbc.edu>

This scene models a procedurally generated fractal mountain.  The mountain is
represented in code by a vector of triangles, which are collections of three
points and their normal vector.  The points are vertex positions and colors.
The provided sample code is used largely untouched.  I modified the key
callback function and added a second light, which I thought made the mountain
look smoother and more realistic.

The project can be built by typing "make" in its base directory.

Seed values of 5, 8, and 11 with several increases to subdivision and random
displacement seem to look pretty good on my machine, but I seem to remember
that the glibc on GL has a slightly different rand function.
