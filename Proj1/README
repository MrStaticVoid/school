HTTP Client
James Lee <jlee23@umbc.edu>

This HTTP client was written to be very modular.  It contains separate libraries to separate out functionality.  The libraries are as follows:

	liburi: uses regex to parse URIs
	liblist: linked list implementation from Wikipedia
	liblog: stores messages, times, and sources in a list
	libhttp: contains functions to communicate with servers using HTTP

The UI was written with ncurses.  It makes use of libcdk for the scrolling log window.  I did not program libcdk, but included it so there would be no dependency issues.

To build and run this program, in the current directory run:

	./configure
	make
	ui/ui

The available commands are documented in the UI.  Type a URL, select a method, choose a place to save.

Overall, the reception of the google start page is consistent with other clients.  The time it took was dependent on other network activity and will vary depending on the connection.
